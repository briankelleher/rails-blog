## Rails Blog Tutorial

Please check out the `process.md` file for instructions on how to build this style of blog from scratch.

The purpose of this project is to provide an easy, open source, starter project and tutorial for a basic admin-only blog in Ruby on Rails.  After digging into this project, one should have a very basic understanding of the file structure in rails, how controllers, models, migration, and seeding works, how to create relationships between models, and how to modify views and controllers to show data.

## Contributing

I would love contributions!  Anything to make this tutorial better, especially feature based.  For example, I can see some improvements in the future:

* Add a date based archive
* Add basic dynamic navigation links
* Pagination
* Ajax forms

Feel free to submit a pull request/issue and send me a message with any questions!
